I have started learning Spring_Boot and learned to do my first API which just says hello student set up runnable
Also learned to do some changes and features in API and stored it in lemonAPI by using a simple logical thinking program in java
Learned to do more annotations in Spring Boot (@GetMapping, @RestController, @Controller, @PostMapping, @PutMapping

Learned to get data from data and saved it in repository
